**Welcome to LogUI!** *LogUI* is a powerful, framework-agnostic client-side JavaScript library that can be used for logging interactions that take place on a webpage. Primarily designed for *Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR)* experiments, LogUI can in theory be used on any page or site that you wish to track fine-grained user interactions with UI components.

This repository houses sample applications that use LogUI to capture user interactions. Each directory off the root of this repository contains a unique application.
